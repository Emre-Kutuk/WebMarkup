    <h2>About Haarlem Center</h2>
    <article class="flex">
        <p>
            Haarlem-Center is a part of the city of Haarlem and coincides with the only neighborhood in this part of the city the Old City , which is popularly 
            called simply "the City" . The district has 13,830 inhabitants and consists of five neighborhoods, including the historic city ​​center and the 
            Stationsbuurt , where the city's largest station is located. The Old City, surrounded by canals, is characterized by many old streets and monuments.
            At the heart of the city center lies the Grote Markt in the city center, which houses a number of special historic buildings, including the town hall , 
            the Vleeshal and the Grote or St. Bavo church. The downtown skyline is dominated by this huge church with its almost 80 meter high tower. Many famous musicians, 
            including Mozart, may have played in the world-famous Müller organ in the church. There is a market twice a week on the Grote Markt and various events take 
            place throughout the year, including the annual fair. Important shopping streets run from Grote Markt in three directions, namely Grote Houtstraat , 
            Barteljorisstraat and Zijlstraat . There are a number of small, characteristic shopping streets in the historic center, such as Warmoesstraat, Schagchelstraat 
            and Kleine Houtstraat. The Spaarne River divides the city center into two parts. West of the river is the largest part of the city center. To the east the part 
            that is also called the Spaarnwouderbuurt . In this part, among other things, the only remaining city gate of Haarlem is the Spaarnwouder or Amsterdamse Poort . 
            The mill De Adriaan and Koepelgevangenis are also located here . Both banks of the Spaarne are connected by two monumental swing bridges, the Catharijnebrug 
            and the Melkbrug and two drawbridges including the Gravestenenbrug, and a modern drawbridge. This bridge, popularly called the 'Verfroller', is officially called 
            the Long Bridge. The neighborhood that lies between the Nieuwe Gracht and the station, the Stationsbuurt , was built in the second half of the 19th century. 
            There are many large patrician houses along the Nieuwe Gracht. In the 60s and 70s of the 19th century the villas at the Kenaupark and the Ripperdapark and 
            at the Bolwerken were built.
